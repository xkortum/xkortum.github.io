about_me_description: I am currently holding a Doctor degree from Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig and have 8+ years of experience as a Computer and Data Scientist researcher and practitioner. I've previously worked at prestigious institutions such as Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, and the University of Wisconsin. My technical expertise includes database programming, fluency in programming languages such as R, Python, C++, C#, Java, and Objective C, as well as extensive experience in web design and MVC architectures. My conscientious approach and project management skills have resulted in the successful completion of numerous research projects, and my contributions have been published in prestigious journals such as PLoS ONE and BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making. I speak English and Chinese fluently and understand German (Elementary - B2). I'm fascinated by cutting-edge technologies and life philosophies from different cultures.
